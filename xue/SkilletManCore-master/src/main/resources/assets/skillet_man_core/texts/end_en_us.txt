——§l§6《Chronicles of the Cauldron: Final Chapter》§r——

§bStellar rivers wax and wane, as a celestial wanderer descends.

The void-traveling warrior named 「PLAYERNAME」 wields a nine-star wok as his blade,
By day crafting delicacies for common folk,
By night wielding dark iron to guard against the End.

All praise his virtue, unaware the seeds of calamity
had long been buried in shadowed springs.

§rIn primordial days, the Nether's demon lord coveted the Overworld's essence,
secretly forging three thousand cursed cauldrons.
Those who feast from these infernal vessels
shall find flesh crystallizing into crimson-eyed stone,
their souls branded with hellfire sigils.

Yet the End's dragon-shadows barred the demonic horde,
Thus a black-robed false priest was sent to dwell among villages,
weaving lies that blamed the End for all misfortunes,
luring the warrior to wield these cursed cauldrons as weapons.

§cThe fiends slain by night, the feasts cooked by day—
Twin-edged blades devouring souls, yet none perceived the truth!

§rWhen the End crumbled, scarlet miasma veiled the moon.
§cThose who had tasted the wok's bounty now grew scales and horns,
their eyes blazing furnaces, kneeling beneath the Nether's bloodied banners.

§cThe false priest clapped and laughed, revealing his rakshasa form:
"The End's remnants you slaughtered, warrior,
were but seasoning for mankind's corruption!"
§cAs the Nether Lord strode through flames,
the Overworld's pillars began to collapse.

§bThough the warrior reclaimed his astral power,
he gazed upon the land—
Where chimney smoke curls upward,
who remains untainted by the cauldron's poison?
Amidst steaming stoves,
what ingredient could purge this blight?

§6Behold the prophecy:

§6「By day the cauldron feeds the flame,
§6By night it smites celestial foes.
§6To break hell's chains, first cease its reign—
§6The hero's bones shall stew mankind's woes.」

(Note: The prophecy's riddles suggest salvation lies in overturning the cycle of day-night causality, where the cauldron's dual purpose as tool/weapon becomes the key to severing the Nether's corruption chain.)
